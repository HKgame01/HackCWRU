      What are pesticides?
    </h1>
    <p>
      Pesticides are tools that are designed to help farmers to safely deter or manage pests – such as insects, fungi and weeds – that can threaten the health or quality of their crop. Along with other plant science innovations, pesticides help farmers grow crops more efficiently and sustain-ably than ever before.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Three main types of agricultural pesticides:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Herbicides control weeds so that crops can flourish without unwanted plants competing for vital nutrients, space, water and sunlight.
</li>
      <li>Fungicides protect plants from disease-causing organisms that can spread quickly and destroy fields of crops.</li>
      <li>Insecticides control insects that could damage crops by eating them or infecting them with diseases.</li>
    </ol>
<p>Pesticides are also used in urban settings to protect public green spaces from pests. You might also use pesticides in your own home whether it’s a product that keeps your backyard looking pristine, a chemical you use in your pool or a flea collar for your pet.</p>

<h2>What happens to pesticides in the environment?</h2>
<p>Pesticides have to be released into the environment to kill an intended, targeted pest.<br><br>
Once applied to a lawn or garden, some of the pesticide may travel into the air, soil, groundwater, and surface waters and be carried away from the lawn or garden. Just how fast a pesticide moves off-site from where it’s applied depends on its chemical and physical characteristics. Also, pesticides in the environment can change or degrade due to reactions caused by light, chemical reactions, or biological reactions.<br><br>
<h3>Risk to non-target species</h3>
Pesticides can kill beneficial soil bacteria, earthworms, snails, frogs, birds, fish, honeybees, and other valuable species. Sometimes instructions on the product label include information about risks to these ‘non-target species.’<br><br>

<h3>Pesticides in water samples</h3>
In 1999, researchers from Environment Canada found a number of lawn care pesticides (including mecoprop, 2,4-D and diazinon) in water samples from both the Humber and Don Rivers in Toronto.<br><br>

Lawn care pesticides have also been detected in surface waters in Hamilton, Guelph, and other urban areas. The waters of urban rivers, creeks and ponds do contain lawn care pesticides, and the concentrations are higher after rainfall.<br><br>

In some cases, the highest levels of pesticides (diazinon and 2,4-D) measured in urban ponds and streams have, at times, exceeded the levels set by governments to protect aquatic life. However, there isn’t enough data to tell us how pesticide use affects plants and animals and the overall health of our ecosystems.<br><br>
