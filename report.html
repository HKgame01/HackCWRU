    <h1>How Reliable Are Weather Forecasts?</h1>
    <h2>The Short Answer:</h2>
    <p>A seven-day forecast can accurately predict the weather about 80 percent of the time and a five-day forecast can accurately predict the weather approximately 90 percent of the time. However, a 10-day—or longer—forecast is only right about half the time.</p>
    <h2>The Long Answer:</h2>
    <p>
      If you want to know what the weather will be like within the next week, a weather forecast can give you a really good idea of what to expect. A seven-day forecast can accurately predict the weather about 80 percent of the time and a five-day forecast can accurately predict the weather approximately 90 percent of the time.<br><br>
However, a 10-day—or longer—forecast is only right about half the time. Meteorologists use computer programs called weather models to make forecasts. Since we can’t collect data from the future, models have to use estimates and assumptions to predict future weather. The atmosphere is changing all the time, so those estimates are less reliable the further you get into the future.

    <h2>How Weather Forecasts Are Made</h2>
    <p>
      Some of the information needed to make a weather forecast comes from environmental satellites. NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, operates three types of environmental satellites that monitor Earth’s weather:</p>
      <h3>Geostationary Satellites</h3>
    <p>
      NOAA’s Geostationary Environmental Operational Satellite-R (GOES-R) series satellites orbit approximately 22,000 miles above Earth and they provide a picture of what the weather is like right now. “Geostationary” means that the satellites orbit at the same rate that the Earth rotates. This means they can collect near-continuous images over the same area. Because they focus on one spot, they can provide up-to-the-minute information about severe weather. This information helps forecasters understand how quickly a storm, such as a hurricane, is growing and moving.
    </p>
      <h3>Polar-orbiting Satellites</h3>
    <p>
      Satellites as part of NOAA’s Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) orbit approximately 500 miles above Earth. They zip around our planet from pole to pole 14 times per day. Because they orbit while the Earth is rotating below, these satellites can see every part of Earth twice each day. Polar orbiting satellites can monitor the entire Earth’s atmosphere, clouds and oceans at high resolution. By watching these global weather patterns, polar orbiting satellites can help meteorologists accurately predict long-term forecasts—up to 7 days in the future.
    </p>
      <h3>Deep Space Satellite</h3>
    
      <p>
        NOAA’s Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) orbits one million miles from Earth. It provides space weather alerts and forecasts while also monitoring the amounts of solar energy absorbed by Earth every day. DSCOVR also makes observations about ozone and aerosols in Earth’s atmosphere. These factors are important in making air quality forecasts.
